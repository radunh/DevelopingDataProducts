# DevelopingDataProducts

In the Master Branch we have the shiny server.R and ui.R.  The data is held in a local rda file, crimeusa.rda, which is a leveled version of 'violent_crime' data file.  

In the gh-branch we have the index.Pres and index.html which are the files created and generated by R Studio Presenter.  The data comes directly from 'violent_crime' data set.
